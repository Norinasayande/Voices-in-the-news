      "Taylor Swift has won hundreds of awards, but she'll likely never forget her 2009 Best Female Video at the MTV Video Music Awards. Rapper Kanye West rushed the stage, stealing the microphone from the unsuspecting singer and insisting fellow nominee Beyonce had 'one of the best videos of all time.' However, six years later the two seemed chummy as they posed backstage at the 57th Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. Scroll down for video . Reconciled: It looks like all is good between Kanye West (L) and Taylor Swift (R) after the former infamously interrupted the singer's MTV VMA acceptance speech . Bad Blood: Taylor was taken by surprise when Kanye rushed the stage back in 2009 when she won Best Female Video . In one shot, the unlikely duo appear to be engaged in a handshake, as they both sport wide grins, which is also unusual for Kanye. The pair were also spotted posing together, standing close as both sported large smiles for the cameras. This comes as a surprise after the shocking interruption that threw off the Blank Space singer's 2009 VMA acceptance speech. Playful: Taylor and Kanye sported wide grins as they shook hands at the 57th Grammy Awards on Sunday . Bury the hatchet? It seems Taylor may have made a new famous friend after Sunday's Grammy ceremony . Elie Saab teal gown . Click to check out the current line at Net-a-Porter! Visit site . Taylor Swift was clearly having a fantastic time at the Grammys last night as she danced up a storm. Shake it off and all that! And we give her credit for busting some moves because her dress wasn't exactly the most conducive to getting down! The pop starlet chose a dramatic gown by Elie Saab for the awards show and while we love the combined mini and maxi cut, it wasn't the most practical of looks. The teal fabric is just beautiful and has an iridescence that really makes an impact. Plus those pink Giuseppe Zanotti heels are a genius touch of styling. Well played Taylor. Teal and turquoise can sometimes be tricky to pull off but it just requires taking the time to find out the right shade for you. So why not give it a go at your next black tie event? It will certainly make a change from all the black and you'll be sure to turn heads. So start your search with our edit below.

After it was announced that Taylor had one Best Female Video for You Belong With Me, Kanye West rushed the stage to denounce her victory over close friend Beyonce. Taylor began her acceptance speech for the coveted award, saying: 'Thank you so much! I always dreamed about what it would be like to maybe win one of these some day, but I never actually thought it would have happened. I sing country music so thank you so much for giving me a chance to win a VMA award.' However, she was quickly interrupted by Kanye, who said: 'Taylor, I'm really happy for you, I'mma let you finish, but Beyoncé has one of the best videos of all time. One of the best videos of all time.' Surprise appearance: Kayne ran onto stage to protest Taylor's win, insisting that Beyonce's video was 'one of the best videos of all time' Shocked: The 1989 hitmaker was speechless after the rapper stole her microphone at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards ceremony . He was referencing Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It) which was also nominated in the category. However, the mortified look on Beyonce's face seemed to hint she didn't share his opinion of Taylor's win. She later invited Taylor onstage to give a proper acceptance speech when she won the award for Video of the Year. However, it appears the bad blood between the two artists is in the past, as they posed playfully at the 2015 Grammy ceremony. Working things out: Perhaps Taylor wanted to amend her issues with Kanye upon growing discussion of her feud with Katy Perry . Meeting the family: The songstress also took time to chat with Kanye's wife, reality star Kim Kardashian . Playing mediator? (L to R) Taylor's new pal Jay Z could also have played a hand in she and Kanye - pictured here with with Kim - resolving their issues . But even though he made his peace with Taylor, the rapper still showed a bit of a naughty streak as he recreated his 2009 VMA moment by running the stage following Beck's win for Album of the Year for Morning Phase. The artist beat out Beyonce's self-titled album, and for a moment it looked as if Kayne was going steal another microphone, but he quickly changed his mind and returned to his seat. At the awards show Taylor was nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year - which both went to Sam Smith - and Best Pop Solo Performance - which went to Pharrell. She did take the stage to introduce pal Sam Smith's performance, as well as to present his victory in the category of Best New Artist. Kanye was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration - which he lost to Eminem and Rihanna - and Best Rap Song - which he lost to Kendrick Lamar. He also performed at the event, returning to the Grammy stage for the first time in six years for both his single Only One, and his collaboration with Paul McCartney and Rihanna, FourFiveSeconds. Deja vu? Kanye almost repeated his 2009 moment, as he rushed the stage following Beck's win for Album of the Year, but quickly changed his mind and returned to his seat . Thrilled: Taylor was elated to present the award for Best New Artist to her pal Sam Smith .

      "By . Leah Simpson . PUBLISHED: . 16:46 EST, 19 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:31 EST, 20 July 2012 . With the season finale airing on Sunday night, The Bachelorette star Emily Maynard is already making arrangements to extend her 15 minutes of fame - with a move to Hollywood on the cards. But in the meantime, Emily Maynard is pinned down to North Carolina. The 26-year-old single mother stepped out in the city of Charlotte today and while she couldn’t enjoy the luxury of a meal in public with her beau, she instead joined a female friend for lunch. Lady of leisure: Emily Maynard grabbed lunch with a friend in Charlotte, North Carolina today . The blonde bombshell was spotted going for lunch in an eye-catching purple maxi dress. She carried a cream bag and donned huge sunglasses as she entered an eatery in the location where the eighth season of the reality show is being filmed. The day before she was seen stopping at Charlotte Skins & Laser to get a facial treatment in between running errands. BFF time: She donned a purple maxi dress to the eatery as she enjoys her time before The Bachelorette season finale on Sunday . This time donning a light tie-dye style floor-length dress and tying her long hair back. Perhaps she was freshening up her face in preparation for her relocation to Los Angeles with her five-year-old daughter Josephine Riddick 'Ricki' Hendrick. She has been excitedly talking about her initial plans when she arrives in California. Star style: Emily fashioned some large sunglasses and a cream bag . But while it might be a good idea to have some business meetings booked in, Emily is more concerned with beauty appointments to keep her looking like a star. She tweeted: ‘My first stop when I get to LA is going to be @StriptWaxBarLA because my brows are a mess! @TheAmyBean put it on your calendar its a date.’ Recent reports suggest she is hoping to capitalise on the show's success by starring in a spin-off with her rumoured new love Jef Holm. Hollywood-bound: She has been talking about her move to Los Angeles while rumours suggest she is hoping to land another reality TV gig . A source suggested she is hoping to continue her television career like fellow show alumni Trista and Ryan Sutter did. The insider said: 'Emily wants to do a spin-off which would include the planning of the wedding. 'She loves to be in front of the camera and there are multiple offers on the table for her to do other television shows.' Camera-ready: Emily Maynard stopped by at Charlotte Skins & Laser to get a facial yesterday . She has to wait to open discussions about her spin-off plans until the show's finale airs on Sunday however. The source added: 'Emily can't formally have discussions yet because the finale hasn't aired. 'But she's really excited to get the date, location and all of the details set so that she can marry Jef and having it air on TV fits in perfectly with her plans.' Happy couple: Emily is engaged to get married to Jef Holm apparently .\n",

      "By . Toni Jones . PUBLISHED: . 09:29 EST, 16 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:26 EST, 16 October 2012 . Tonight's grand final of the Great British Bake Off is expected to draw over four million viewers. Not bad for a genteel BBC2 show about cakes. The show has become one of BBC2’s biggest success stories with a peak of 4.6 million tuning in each week to see presenters Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc and judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry whip up a TV storm. The show has been credited with making baking cool again, and reminding boys where the kitchen is (tonight's final is all male and judge Paul Hollywood's heartthrob status continues to soar). But Brtiain's love of baking isn't really new at all - just ask your grandmother. The trend for home baking has been in and out of vogue many times over the last century . From the launch of Good Housekeeping magazine in the 1920s to the introduction of TV chefs post-Coronation in the 1950s, the last century has seen the popularity of baking rise and fall according to social and economic trends. Today's thrifty climate means that we are enjoying home comforts as well as needing to stretch our bank accounts while in the 1930s the increasing popularity of cars and therefore picnics caused a boom in baking, and in the 1980s celebrity chef Delia Smith stirred our passions for the kitchen with her 'How to Cook' book. Factors contributing to the decline in home baking over the century include women going to work in the 1910s, rationing in the 1940s and mass produced processed food arriving in homes in the 1960s. To celebrate National Baking Week (which runs from 15th-21st October) and the Great British Bake Off final kitchen appliance company Kenwood has compiled a time line of baking trends with help from Wendy Wilson, archivist from Britain's oldest weekly women's magazine The Lady, and Dr Valerie Mars, a food historian. Dr Mars says: 'Baking trends are essentially uneven. Some people will always bake, especially in places with a long-standing tradition such as Yorkshire, but fashion also has a huge influence. In the current economic climate, an increase in baking at home by those who discover and enjoy the craft provides a logical way of economising during hard times.' Bake Off judge and trained baker Paul Hollywood seen today ahead of the final . Paul and fellow judge Mary Berry have gained a cult following on the show . Paul and fellow judge Mary Berry have gained a cult following on the show . Good Housekeeping magazine in 1932 focused on 'meals for the business girl' The popularity of new domestic appliances in the 1950s led to a rise in the trend for home baking . In the seventies the rise of the middle class meant that dinner parties became popular . Delia Smith, celebrity chef and Norwich fan lured us back in to the kitchen in the nineties with her back to basics approach . 4 million viewers are expected to watch finalists John Waite, James Morton and Brendan Lynch battle it out for the Great British Bake Off crown tonight in front of judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry and presenters Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc .\n",
      "The Great British Bake Off final expects to draw an audience of over 4 million tonight . 27% of Britons say they will bake more in the next year . National Baking Week runs 15th -21st October . Baking is most popular in Yorkshire . 1 in 7 adults bake at least twice a week . Servants leave for the First World War and work in other careers. Women work in armament factories and in other jobs, giving them less time to bake . The Women’s Institute is founded in 1915. Advice on cookery is offered and members share their experiences at meetings. After the war their magazine Home and Country, offers recipes and advice . The National Confectionary Industry started to issue adverts in press, encouraging women to take up home baking as a source of extra income . Good Housekeeping Magazine is first published in 1922 . Ready shredded packets of beef suet are advertised with the strapline of “What visions of delight...”. The advert refers to Spotted Dick amongst others recipes - this is for women who continue to bake . Increase in car travel meant out-of-home dining experiences such as picnics became popular, with a variety of baking recipes dedicated to on-the-go food . The Great Depression migrating to the UK meant that many households were unable to sustain their purchase of luxury baking ingredients, so alternative products such as margarine (instead of butter) became commonplace in the pantry.  Home baking with these cheaper products was encouraged as a way of stretching the pennies . Leaflets from organisations such as the Potato Marketing Board issued recipe books, and companies like Stork, who had big advertising campaigns, promoted margarine . Banana Cakes first appeared in cookbooks – grocers would share these recipes with customers when the fruit became over ripe to avoid wastage . The rationing of the war era meant that homes had to make do with what little fresh produce they could source. Kitchen waste was eliminated and the likes of Dripping Cake recipes were eagerly shared between housewives . Alternative cooking methods, such as pressure cookers, started to appear in the kitchen following the war – therefore it was no longer all about the oven as the main way to cook food, reducing the need to bake . Bread consumption was at a consistently high level in the 1940s (~1700g) - DEFRA . The consumption of cakes stood at 190g per person per week in 1950 - DEFRA . The introduction of the Kenwood Chef to market, in 1950, prompted a shift in how housewives made their home baked goods in the UK and globally . Baking oligopolies were producing sliced loaves such as Mother’s Pride and Sunblest, while Lyons was the major supplier of inexpensive cakes, producing Swiss Roll by the mile . After the Coronation, more homes had acquired televisions, so TV cookery now had a wider audience. Among the earliest TV cooks was Philip Harben . With the continued rationing of sugar until 1953, a variety of alternatives were commonly used to satisfy the nation’s sweet tooth. These included Golden Syrup, treacle, condensed milk and honey . The 1960s saw TV chef Fanny Craddock inspire housewives to become more adventurous with their cooking . The traditional ‘tea time’ of a cuppa with homemade cakes and buns faded from everyday life . Mass produced goods, such as bread and biscuits, became staples in the local stores . During a 50 year research window, the consumption of biscuits peaked at 166g per person in 1967 - DEFRA . Local charity groups encouraged women to get involved and raise money by baking at home for bake-sales, as ‘their contribution’ to the cause . Introduction of ‘foreign food’ such as pizza and pasta to the home meant that even more choice became available to the everyday family cook, not all of which would need to be baked . The first campaign for real bread is launched in 1976 promoting better quality commercial baking and home baking. The emphasis focused on wholemeal bread, which was a minority taste . The rise of the ‘middle classes’ meant that the dinner party became the  way to outdo the Jones, typified by the likes of Mike Leigh’s ‘Abigail’s Party’.  The need for special creations meant that many experimented with new and challenging recipes such as soufflé . Another campaign for Real Bread is launched, this time by ‘The Sunday Times’ with food writer Caroline Conran, medical correspondent Oliver Gillie and journalist Michael Bateman . The rise in popularity of the prefab kitchen meant that the kitchen essentials – such as the oven and hob – were ‘out of sight and out of mind’ for many homecooks . By 1986, 1 in 5 households was estimated to have a microwave which was said to help reduce cooking time by 75% and gave rise to the influx of ready meals . The consumption of cakes had dropped to a half century low at 69g per person per week in 1989 – DEFRA . At home, popular tray bakes - cakes baked in a square pan using flour, eggs, sugar butter or margarine - were a simple answer to producing cake in a hurry . In 1988, Edwina Curry resigned from the Conservative government over her statement that British eggs were contaminated with Salmonella. This caused a fall in sales and problems for domestic cooks . Delia Smith’s TV series ‘How to Cook’ acknowledges that many people do not even know how to boil an egg. The . series and her book were best sellers . New style wedding cakes were made by arranging cup cakes on tiered wire stands. An individual cake for each guest and nothing for the couple to cut, a true creation for the age of individualism . A new enthusiasm for artisan baking was typified by De Gustibus bakery, opened in Oxfordshire in 1990. The bakery was originally based on a home baking business. De Gustibus has won several awards including Best Independent Baker of the Year in 1997. Enthusiasts like these bakers were producing similar products at home using organic craft milled flours . Up until 2000, there was little indication that home baking had increased with a steady drop in the consumption of flour (206g in 1950 to 67g in 2000) and sugar (287g in 1950 to 105g in 2000) - DEFRA . From 2001-2006 the sale of home baking products increased by 25%, bringing total sales to £429 million in 2006 - Mintel . Luxury cupcakes started to become the ‘must munch’ baked good after Carrie Bradshaw from Sex in the City bought one from the New York Magnolia Bakery.  By 2010 cupcakes became the second most popular type of cake to bake at home - Mintel . The government’s ‘Reduce, Reuse and Recycle’ campaign hit home, with many households looking at inventive ways to bake with leftovers or surplus vegetables . The revival in home baking helped the sector to grow by 13% between 2007 and 2009 - Mintel . 2010 research shows that over half of Brits (52%) say that they get recipe ideas from online websites compared to the 46% who rely on cookbooks, driving easy access to baking inspiration - Mintel . Tightening the belt to stave off the recession in the home has resulted in many families baking their own bread to combat rocketing pre-made loaf prices . The royal wedding gave rise to street parties lined with Union Jack cupcakes and iced versions of Will and Kate . Home-made cakes have started to gained in popularity as an alternative to expensive gifts . The TV show ‘Great British Bake Off’ has captured the imagination of the nation and highlighted the joys of baking .\n"
